"a string\" with escapes"
"'single quotes' are allowed unescaped or \' escaped"</pre><p>They can also be enclosed in single quotes:</p><pre class="good-ex pyret-highlight">'a string'
'a string\' with escapes'
'"double quotes" are allowed unescaped or \" escaped'</pre><p>String literals with single or double quotes must terminate by the end of the line:</p><pre class="bad-ex pyret-highlight">"multi-line
strings not
allowed with double quotes"</pre><p>Finally, multi-line string literals can be created by starting and ending them with three backticks (<tt class="pyretexpr">```</tt>).  For example:</p><pre class="good-ex pyret-highlight">```
This string
spans
multiple lines
```</pre><p>Multi-line string literals strip all whitespace before the first non-whitespace character and after the last non-whitespace character.  All whitespace at the beginning of intermediate lines is preserved.</p><h3 id="f:number_literals" toclevel="3" tocentry="yes">Number Literals</h3><p><bnf>&Pyret;num-expr: NUMBER</bnf></p><p>Pyret has several types of number literals.  The most traditional allows for decimal numbers, negation, and an exponent:</p><div class="insetpara nested"><pre class="nothing_special">^[-+]?[0-9]+(?:\\.[0-9]+)?(?:[eE][-+]?[0-9]+)?</pre></div><p>That is, an optional sign, then some number of digits, optionally followed by a decimal point and more digits, optionally followed by an exponent.  These are valid number literals:</p><pre class="good-ex pyret-highlight">0.1

-1.1e-100
1.1230e-0

19.0</pre><p>Note that a number literal cannot start with a decimal point; some leading digits are required.  These are not number literals:</p><pre class="bad-ex pyret-highlight">.1
1.1.1
1.+1
0.1+100</pre><p>This first kind of number literal represents an <i>exact</i> number, or <a href="../builtin/numbers.html#Exactnum"><tt class="pyretexpr">Exactnum</tt></a>.  Number literals can also be prefixed with a tilde, to indicate that the number is an approximation, or a <a href="../builtin/numbers.html#Roughnum"><tt class="pyretexpr">Roughnum</tt></a>.  So these are all valid rough number literals:</p><pre class="good-ex pyret-highlight">~0.1

~1.1e100
~+1.1e100
~-1.1e-100

~19.0</pre><p>And these are not valid:</p><pre class="bad-ex pyret-highlight">~.1
~1.1.1
~1.+1
~0.1+100</pre><p>Finally, numbers can be written as exact ratios of whole numbers:</p><div class="insetpara nested"><pre class="nothing_special">^[-+]?[0-9]+/[0-9]+</pre></div><p>These numbers are interpreted as <a href="../builtin/numbers.html#Exactnum"><tt class="pyretexpr">Exactnum</tt></a>s.  These are valid rational literals:</p><pre class="good-ex pyret-highlight">1/2
-1/2

These are uniformly represented as <ref-gloss>‹binding›</ref-gloss>s:</p><p><bnf>&Pyret;binding: name-binding | tuple-binding name-binding: [SHADOW] NAME [COLONCOLON ann] tuple-binding: LBRACE (binding SEMI)* binding [SEMI] RBRACE [AS name-binding] SHADOW: “shadow” COLONCOLON: ”::” SEMI: ”;” LBRACE: “{” RBRACE: ”}” AS: “as”</bnf></p><h3 id="Name-bindings" toclevel="3" tocentry="yes">Name bindings</h3><p>The simplest form of binding is a <ref-gloss>‹name-binding›</ref-gloss>.  This form simply associates a name with a given value:</p><pre class="good-ex pyret-highlight">PI = ~3.141592
five = num-sqrt((3 * 3) + (4 * 4))
hw = string-append("Hello", " world")</pre><h3 id="s:annotated-binding" toclevel="3" tocentry="yes">Annotated bindings</h3><p>Slightly more complicated, a name binding may also specify an <a href="lang/forms.html#s:annotations">annotation</a>, that will ensure that the value being bound has the correct type:</p><pre class="good-ex pyret-highlight">PI :: Number = ~3.141592
hw :: String = string-append("Hello", "world")

this-will-fail :: Boolean = 5</pre><p>That last line will fail at runtime with an annotation error.</p><p>Note that the annotation always comes after the name, not the value; this is not allowed, for instance:</p><pre class="bad-ex pyret-highlight">PI = ~3.14 :: Number</pre><h3 id="s:shadowing" toclevel="3" tocentry="yes">Shadowing</h3><p>Pyret does not permit a program to implicitly bind the same name multiple times in the same scope, as this can be confusing or ambiguous: which name was meant?</p><pre class="bad-ex pyret-highlight">ans = 3 + 4
ans = true # did you mean to use a different name here?

ans # which one was meant?</pre><p>Pyret will signal an error on the second binding of <tt class="pyretexpr">ans</tt> above, saying that it <i>shadows</i> the earlier definition.  The same rule applies to names defined in nested scopes, like functions.  This program is disallowed by the shadowing rule, as well:</p><pre class="bad-ex pyret-highlight">ans = 3 + 4

fun oops(x):
  ans = x * 2  # Shadows the outer ans
  ans
end

fun another-oops(ans): # Also shadows the outer ans
  if ans: 3 else: 4 end
end</pre><p>The general rule for shadowing is to look “upward and leftward”, i.e. looking outward from the current scope to any enclosing scopes, to see if there are any existing bindings of the same name.</p><p>But sometimes, redefining the same name makes the most sense.  In this case, a program can explicitly specify that it means to hide the outer definition, using the <tt class="pyretexpr">shadow</tt> keyword:</p><pre class="good-ex pyret-highlight">ans = 3 + 4
fun oops(x):
  shadow ans = x * 2 # &lt;-------------------------+
  ans    # uses the ans defined the line above --+
end
fun another-oops(shadow ans):
  if ans: 3 else: 3 end # uses the function's parameter
end</pre><h3 id="Tuple-bindings" toclevel="3" tocentry="yes">Tuple bindings</h3><p>Tuples are useful to package up several Pyret values into a single value, which can then be passed around and manipulated as a single entity.  But often, the most useful manipulation is to break the tuple apart into its components.  While there are <ref-gloss>‹tuple-get›</ref-gloss> expressions to access individual components, it’s often easiest to give all the components names.  We do this with a <ref-gloss>‹tuple-binding›</ref-gloss>, which binds each component of a tuple to its own name. The number of bindings must match the length of the given tuple:</p><div><p><b>Examples:</b></p><pre class="pyret-highlight">check:
  {x; y} = {1; 2}
  x is 1
  y is 2

  fun sum-two({k; v}, {a; b; c}):
    k + v + a + b + c
  end

  sum-two({10; 12}, {1; 4; 5}) is 32

  fun sum-vals(elts) block:
    var sum = 0
    for each({k; v} from elts):
      sum := sum + v
    end
    sum
  end

  elts = [list: {"a"; 5}, {"b"; 6}, {"c"; 7}]
  sum-vals(elts) is 18
end</pre></div><p>It is also possible to <i>nest</i> tuple bindings, if the tuple being bound has tuples nested inside it:</p><div><p><b>Examples:</b></p><pre class="pyret-highlight">check:
  {{w; x}; {y; z}} = {{~5; true}; {"hello"; 4}}
  w is-roughly ~5
  x is true
  y is "hello"
  z is 4
end</pre></div><p>Nested bindings likewise must match the number of components in the tuple being bound, and follow the same rules of shadowing as normal name bindings.</p><p>With nested tuples, it is sometimes also useful to not only decompose the nested tuples into their components, but to give a name to the nested tuple itself:</p><div><p><b>Examples:</b></p><pre class="pyret-highlight">check:
  {{w; x} as wx; {y; z} as yz} as wxyz = {{~5; true}; {"hello"; 4}}
  w is-roughly ~5
  x is true
  y is "hello"
  z is 4
  wx is-roughly {~5; true}
  yz is {"hello"; 4}
  wxyz is {wx; yz}
end</pre></div><p>As with any other name bindings, you can provide annotations on any of these components.  The rule of annotations adjacent to names applies–the tuple components and the <tt class="pyretexpr">as</tt> name can have annotations.  We demonstrate both permitted styles of annotation below:</p><pre class="good-ex pyret-highlight">check:
  {
    {w :: Number; x :: Boolean} as wx;
    {y; z} as yz :: {String; Number}
  } as wxyz = {{~5; true}; {"hello"; 4}}
  w is-roughly ~5
  x is true
  y is "hello"
  z is 4
  wx is-roughly {~5; true}
  yz is {"hello"; 4}
  wxyz is {wx; yz}
end</pre><p>But this is not allowed, because the <tt class="pyretexpr">{Number; Boolean}</tt> annotation is not adjacent to a name:</p><pre class="bad-ex pyret-highlight">check:
  {{w; x} :: {Number; Boolean} as wx; yz} = {{~5; true}; {"hello"; 4}}
  w is ~5
  x is true
end</pre><h2 id="Blocks" toclevel="2" tocentry="yes">Blocks</h2><p>A block’s syntax is a list of statements:</p><p><bnf>&Pyret;block: stmt* user-block-expr: BLOCK block END BLOCK: “block:” END: “end”</bnf></p><p>Blocks serve two roles in Pyret:</p><ul><li>Sequencing of operations</li><li>Units of lexical scope</li></ul><p>The <ref-gloss>‹let-decl›</ref-gloss>, <ref-gloss>‹fun-decl›</ref-gloss>, <ref-gloss>‹data-decl›</ref-gloss>, and <ref-gloss>‹var-decl›</ref-gloss> forms are handled specially and non-locally within blocks.  A detailed description of scope will appear here soon.</p><p>Blocks evaluate each of their statements in order, and evaluate to the value of the final statement in the block.</p><p>The <ref-gloss>‹user-block-expr›</ref-gloss> form <i>additionally</i> creates a scope for any names bound inside it.  That is, definitions within such a block are visible only within that block:</p><pre class="pyret-highlight">x = 10
ans = block:
  y = 5 + x # x is visible here
  42 # value result of the block
end
z = y + ans # error: y is not in scope here</pre><h3 id="s:blocky-blocks" toclevel="3" tocentry="yes">Block Shorthand</h3><p>Many expressions in Pyret include one or more blocks within them.  For example, the body of a function is defined as a block.  Technically, this means the following program is legal:</p><pre class="bad-ex pyret-highlight">fun weather-reaction(forecast, temp):
  ask:
    | forecast == "sunny" then: "sunglasses"
    | forecast == "rainy" then: "umbrella"
    | otherwise: ""
  end
  ask:
    | temp &gt; 85 then: "shorts"
    | temp &gt; 50 then: "jeans"
    | temp &gt; 0 then: "parka"
    | otherwise: "stay inside!"
  end
end</pre><p>However, the program probably won’t behave as expected: rather than returning some combination of “sunglasses” and “shorts” for a warm, sunny day, it will evaluate the first <tt class="pyretexpr">ask</tt> expression, <i>discard the result</i>, and then evaluate the second <tt class="pyretexpr">ask</tt> expression and return its result.</p><p>Pyret will warn the programmer if it encounters programs like these, and complain that the block contains multiple expressions.  Often as in this case, it signals a real mistake, and the programmer ought to revise the code to comprise a single expression—say, by concatenating the two results above.  Sometimes, though, multiple expressions are deliberate:</p><pre class="bad-ex pyret-highlight">if some-condition():
  temp = some-complicated-expression()
  print(temp) # make sure we got it right!
  do-something-with(temp)
else:
  do-something-else()
end</pre><p>To tell Pyret that these multiple statements are intentional, we could write an explicit <tt class="pyretexpr">block</tt> form:</p><pre class="ok-ex pyret-highlight">if some-condition():
  block:
    temp = some-complicated-expression()
    print(temp) # make sure we got it right!
    do-something-with(temp)
  end
else:
  do-something-else()
end</pre><p>...but that is syntactically annoying for a straightforward situation! Instead, Pyret allows for block <i>shorthands</i>: writing <tt class="pyretexpr">block</tt> before the opening colon of a blocky expression signals that the expression is deliberate.</p><pre class="good-ex pyret-highlight">if some-condition() block:
  temp = some-complicated-expression()
  print(temp) # make sure we got it right!
  do-something-with(temp)
else:
  do-something-else()
end</pre><p>The leading <tt class="pyretexpr">block</tt> allows for multiple statements in <i>all</i> of the blocks of this expression.  Analogous markers exist for <ref-gloss>‹ask-expr›</ref-gloss>, <ref-gloss>‹cases-expr›</ref-gloss>, <ref-gloss>‹fun-decl›</ref-gloss>, etc.</p><p>However, even this marker is sometimes too much.  Suppose we eliminated the <tt class="pyretexpr">print</tt> call in the example above:</p><pre class="pyret-highlight">if some-condition() block:
  temp = some-complicated-expression()
  do-something-with(temp)
else:
  do-something-else()
end</pre><p>Why should this expression be penalized, but the equivalent one, where we inline the definition of <tt class="pyretexpr">temp</tt>, not be?  After all, this one is clearer to read!  In fact, Pyret will <i>not</i> complain about this block containing multiple expressions.  Instead, Pyret will consider the following to be valid “non-blocky” blocks:</p><p><bnf>&Pyret;non-blocky-block: stmt* template-expr stmt* | let-decl* expr | user-block-expr</bnf></p><p>Any sequence of let-bindings followed by exactly one expression is fine, as is any block containing even a single template-expression, or (obviously) an explicit <tt class="pyretexpr">block</tt> expression.  All other blocks will trigger the multiple-expressions warning and require either an explicit block or a block-shorthand to fix.</p><h2 id="s:declarations" toclevel="2" tocentry="yes">Declarations</h2><p>There are a number of forms that can only appear as statements in <tt class="pyretexpr">block</tt>s (rather than anywhere an expression can appear).  Several of these are <i>declarations</i>, which define new names within their enclosing block. <ref-gloss>‹data-decl›</ref-gloss> and <ref-gloss>‹contract›</ref-gloss> are exceptions, and can appear only at the top level.</p><p><bnf>&Pyret;stmt: let-decl | rec-decl | fun-decl | var-decl | type-stmt | newtype-stmt     | data-decl | contract</bnf></p><h3 id="s:let-decl" toclevel="3" tocentry="yes">Let Declarations</h3><p>Let declarations are written with an equals sign:</p><p><bnf>&Pyret;EQUALS: “=” let-decl: binding EQUALS binop-expr</bnf></p><p>A let statement causes the name in the <tt class="pyretexpr">binding</tt> to be put in scope in the current block, and upon evaluation sets the value to be the result of evaluating the <tt class="pyretexpr">binop-expr</tt>.  The resulting binding cannot be changed via an <ref-gloss>‹assign-stmt›</ref-gloss>, and cannot be shadowed by other bindings within the same or nested scopes:</p><pre class="pyret-highlight">x = 5
x := 10
# Error: x is not assignable

fun g():

# Not an error: x is used in two scopes that are not nested</pre><p>A binding also has a case with tuples, where several names can be given in a binding which can then be assigned to values in a tuple.</p><pre class="pyret-highlight">{x;y;z} = {"he" + "llo"; true; 42}

It first evaluates the arguments in left-to-right order, then evaluates the function position.  If the function position is a function value, the number of provided arguments is checked against the number of arguments that the function expects.  If they match, the arguments names are bound to the provided values.  If they don’t, an exception is thrown.</p><p>Note that there is <i>no space</i> allowed before the opening parenthesis of the application.  If you make a mistake, Pyret will complain:</p><pre class="pyret-highlight">f(1) # This is the function application expression f(1)
f (1) # This is the id-expr f, followed by the paren-expr (1)

For example, the following are two ways to sum a list of numbers:</p><pre class="pyret-highlight">[list: 1, 2, 3, 4].foldl(lam(a, b): a + b end, 0)

[list: 1, 2, 3, 4].foldl(_ + _, 0)</pre><p>Likewise, the following are two ways to compare two lists for equality:</p><pre class="pyret-highlight">list.map_2(lam(x, y): x == y end, first-list, second-list)

list.map_2(_ == _, first-list, second-list)</pre><p>Note that there are some limitations to this syntactic sugar.  You cannot use it with the <tt class="pyretexpr">is</tt> or <tt class="pyretexpr">raises</tt> expressions in check blocks, since both test expressions and expected outcomes are known when writing tests.  Also, note that the sugar is applied only to one function application at a time.  As a result, the following code:</p><pre class="pyret-highlight">_ + _ + _</pre><p>desugars to</p><pre class="pyret-highlight">lam(z):
  (lam(x, y): x + y end) + z
end</pre><p>which is probably not what was intended.  You can still write the intended expression manually:</p><pre class="pyret-highlight">lam(x, y, z): x + y + z end</pre><p>Pyret just does not provide syntactic sugar to help in this case (or other more complicated ones).</p><h3 id="s:cannonball-expr" toclevel="3" tocentry="yes">Chaining Application</h3><p><index>^ (Chained Application)</index></p><p><bnf>&Pyret;CARET: “^” chain-app-expr: binop-expr CARET binop-expr</bnf></p><p>The expression <tt class="pyretexpr">e1 ^ e2</tt> is equivalent to <tt class="pyretexpr">e2(e1)</tt>.

But arbitrarily-sized data is not as obvious.  For instance, we could write</p><div><p><b>Examples:</b></p><pre class="pyret-highlight">link(1, link(2, link(3, link(4, empty))))</pre></div><p>to construct a 4-element list of numbers, but this gets tiresome quite quickly.  Many languages provide built-in syntactic support for constructing lists, but in Pyret we want all data types to be treated equally.

end</pre></div><h3 id="s:binding-expressions" toclevel="3" tocentry="yes">Expression forms of bindings</h3><p>Every definition in Pyret is visible until the end of its scope, which is usually the nearest enclosing block.  To limit that scope, you can wrap definitions in explicit <ref-gloss>‹user-block-expr›</ref-gloss>s, but this is sometimes awkward to read.  Pyret allows for three additional forms that combine bindings with expression blocks in a manner that is sometimes more legible:</p><p><bnf>&Pyret;LET: “let” LETREC: “letrec” TYPE-LET: “type-let” COMMA: ”,” BLOCK: “block” COLON: ”:” END: “end” EQUALS: “=” NEWTYPE: “newtype” AS: “as” multi-let-expr: LET let-or-var (COMMA let-or-var)* [BLOCK] COLON block END let-or-var: let-decl | var-decl letrec-expr: LETREC let-decl (COMMA let-decl)* [BLOCK] COLON block END type-let-expr: TYPE-LET type-let-or-newtype (COMMA type-let-or-newtype)* [BLOCK] COLON END type-let-or-newtype: type-decl | newtype-decl</bnf></p><p>These define their bindings only for the scope of the following block.  A <ref-gloss>‹multi-let-expr›</ref-gloss> defines a sequence of either let- or variable-bindings, each of which are in scope for subsequent ones.  A <ref-gloss>‹letrec-expr›</ref-gloss> defines a set of mutually-recursive let-bindings that may refer to each other in a well-formed way (i.e., no definition may rely on other definitions before they’ve been fully evaluated).  These are akin to the <ref-gloss>‹let-decl›</ref-gloss> and <ref-gloss>‹var-decl›</ref-gloss> forms seen earlier, but with more explicitly-visible scoping rules.</p><p>Finally, <ref-gloss>‹type-let-expr›</ref-gloss> defines local type aliases or new types, akin to <ref-gloss>‹type-stmt›</ref-gloss>.</p><h2 id="s:annotations" toclevel="2" tocentry="yes">Annotations</h2><p><bnf>&Pyret;ann: name-ann | dot-ann    | app-ann | arrow-ann | pred-ann    | tuple-ann | record-ann</bnf></p><p>Annotations in Pyret express intended types values will have at runtime. They appear next to identifiers anywhere a <tt class="pyretexpr">binding</tt> is specified in the grammar, and if an annotation is present adjacent to an identifier, the program is compiled to raise an error if the value bound to that identifier would behave in a way that violates the annotation.  The annotation provides a <i>guarantee</i> that either the value will behave in a particular way, or the program will raise an exception. In addition, annotations can be checked by Pyret’s <a href="lang/type-check.html#type-check">type checker</a> to ensure that all values have the expected types and are used correctly.</p><h3 id="s:name-ann" toclevel="3" tocentry="yes">Name Annotations</h3><p><bnf>&Pyret;DOT: ”.” name-ann: NAME dot-ann: NAME DOT NAME</bnf> Some annotations are simply names.  For example, a <a href="lang/forms.html#s:data-decl"><tt class="pyretexpr">data declaration</tt></a> binds the name of the declaration as a value suitable for use as a name annotation.  There are built-in name annotations, too:</p><div class="insetpara nested"><pre class="nothing_special">Any
Number
String
Boolean</pre></div><p>Each of these names represents a particular type of runtime value, and using them in annotation position will check each time the identifier is bound that the value is of the right type.</p><pre class="pyret-highlight">x :: Number = "not-a-number"
# Error: expected Number and got "not-a-number"</pre><p><tt class="pyretexpr">Any</tt> is an annotation that allows any value to be used.  It’s semantically equivalent to not putting an annotation on an identifier, but it allows a program to clearly signal that no restrictions are intended for the identifier it annotates.</p><p>Dot-annotations allow for importing types from modules:</p><pre class="pyret-highlight">import equality as EQ
eq-reqult :: EQ.EqualityResult = equal-always3(5, 6)</pre><h3 id="s:app-ann" toclevel="3" tocentry="yes">Parametric Annotations</h3><p><bnf>&Pyret;LANGLE: “&lt;” RANGLE: “&gt;” COMMA: ”,” app-ann: name-ann  LANGLE comma-anns RANGLE | dot-ann LANGLE comma-anns RANGLE comma-anns: ann (COMMA ann)*</bnf></p><p>Many data definitions are parametric, meaning they can contain any uniform type of data, such as lists of numbers.  Accordingly, while the following annotation isn’t quite wrong, it is incomplete:</p><pre class="ok-ex pyret-highlight">list-of-nums :: List = [list: 1, 2, 3]</pre><p>To properly express the constraint on the contents, we need to specialize the list annotation:</p><pre class="good-ex pyret-highlight">list-of-nums :: List&lt;Number&gt; = [list: 1, 2, 3]</pre><p>Note that this annotation will <i>not dynamically check</i> that every item in the list is in fact a <tt class="pyretexpr">Number</tt>—that would be infeasibly expensive.  However, the <a href="lang/type-check.html#type-check">static type checker</a> will make use of this information more fully.</p><h3 id="s:arrow-ann" toclevel="3" tocentry="yes">Arrow Annotations</h3><p>An arrow annotation is used to describe the behavior of functions.  It consists of a list of comma-separated argument types followed by an ASCII arrow and return type.  Optionally, the annotation can specify argument names as well:</p><p><bnf>&Pyret;             LPAREN: “(”              RPAREN: ”)”              THINARROW: “-&gt;”              COMMA: ”,”              COLONCOLON: ”::” arrow-ann: LPAREN (ann COMMA)* ann THINARROW ann RPAREN      | LPAREN LPAREN (NAME COLONCOLON ann COMMA)* NAME COLONCOLON ann RPAREN THINARROW ann RPAREN</bnf></p><p>When an arrow annotation appears in a binding, that binding position simply checks that the value is a function.  To enforce a more detailed check, use <a href="lang/forms.html#s:contracts"></a>.</p><h3 id="s:pred-ann" toclevel="3" tocentry="yes">Predicate Annotations</h3><p>A predicate annotation is used to <i>refine</i> the annotations describing the a value.</p><p><bnf>&Pyret;             PERCENT: “%”              LPAREN: “(”              RPAREN: ”)” pred-ann: ann PERCENT LPAREN NAME RPAREN</bnf></p><p>For example, a function might only work on non-empty lists.  We might write this as</p><pre class="good-ex pyret-highlight">fun do-something-with&lt;a&gt;(non-empty-list :: List&lt;a&gt;%(is-link)) -&gt; a: ... end</pre><p>If we want to write customized predicates, we can easily do so.  Those predicates must be defined <i>before</i> being used in an annotation position, and must be refered to by name.</p><h3 id="s:tuple-ann" toclevel="3" tocentry="yes">Tuple Annotations</h3><p>Annotating a tuple is syntactically very similar to writing a tuple value:</p><p><bnf>&Pyret;LBRACE: “{” RBRACE: ”}” SEMI: ”;” tuple-ann: LBRACE ann (SEMI ann)* [SEMI] RBRACE</bnf></p><p>Each component is itself an annotation.</p><p>For example we could write</p><div><p><b>Examples:</b></p><pre class="pyret-highlight">num-bool :: {Number; Boolean} = {3; true}
num-bool--string-list :: {{Number; Boolean}; {String; List&lt;Any&gt;}} = {{3; true}; {"hi"; empty}}</pre></div><h3 id="s:record-ann" toclevel="3" tocentry="yes">Record Annotations</h3><p>Annotating a record is syntactically very similar to writing a record value, but where the single-colon separators between field names and their values have been replaced with the double-colon of all annotations:</p><p><bnf>&Pyret;LBRACE: “{” RBRACE: ”}” COMMA: ”,” COLONCOLON: ”::” record-ann: LBRACE ann-field (COMMA ann-field)* RBRACE ann-field: NAME COLONCOLON ann</bnf></p><p>As with object literals, the order of fields does not matter.
