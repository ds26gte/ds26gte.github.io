<h1>How to merge a side branch into the main branch safely</h1>
</div>
<div id="content">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Let&#8217;s say the main branch is <code>master</code>. (In newer repos this is
often <code>main</code>.)</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Let&#8217;s also say you branched off a new branch called <code>new-work</code>
from <code>master</code> and started working on a new set of features that&#8217;s
not yet ready for prime time.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>While you&#8217;re working away on <code>new-work</code>, there may be changes
being added to <code>master</code> too. You may want to get all those
changes into <code>new-work</code> too so the latter doesn&#8217;t diverge too
much. This is done with</p>
</div>
<div class="literalblock">
<div class="content">
<pre>git merge master</pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Resolve any conflicts as suggested.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>When you&#8217;re finally satisfied with the work you&#8217;ve done on
<code>new-work</code> and want it to be part of <code>master</code>, you could in
principle check out <code>master</code> and do</p>
</div>
<div class="literalblock">
<div class="content">
<pre>git merge new-work</pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>and resolve any conflicts that arise. However, since you don&#8217;t
want to mess up <code>master</code> with poor conflict resolution and being
saddled with a bungled merge, and since you do want the ability
to test things thoroughly before updating <code>master</code>, here&#8217;s a
sanity check you can do before doing the final merge.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Create a new sandbox branch called <code>new-work-merge</code> off of
<code>new-work</code>:</p>
</div>
<div class="literalblock">
<div class="content">
<pre>git checkout -b new-work-merge</pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>It is safer to bungle merges on this throwaway branch. All you
need to do is delete and try again.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>First, merge <code>master</code> into this new branch:</p>
</div>
<div class="literalblock">
<div class="content">
<pre>git merge master</pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Resolve conflicts in <code>new-work-merge</code>, even the ones that aren&#8217;t
overtly warned by Git. Test everything thoroughly. Satisfy
yourself this is really the final merged code that you want.
Commit to <code>new-work-merge</code>.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Then check out <code>master</code> and merge <code>new-work-merge</code> into it. This
should go with no conflicts whatsoever (because you already
resolved them before commiting <code>new-work-merge</code>).</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Alternately, if there were no conflicts when you merged <code>master</code>
into <code>new-work-merge</code>, you could check out <code>master</code> and simply do</p>
</div>
<div class="literalblock">
<div class="content">
<pre>git merge new-work</pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The branches <code>new-work</code> and <code>new-work-merge</code> may then be removed.</p>
